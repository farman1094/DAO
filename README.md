# DAO Controlled Contract with ERC20 Voting
This project implements a smart contract controlled by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The DAO governs all transactions through a voting process, utilizing ERC20 tokens as the voting mechanism.

## Overview
**1. DAO Controlled Contract**:
The contract is managed by a DAO, ensuring decentralized control and governance.

**2. Transaction Voting**:
Every transaction initiated by the DAO must undergo a voting process. The decision-making process is transparent and democratic, allowing token holders to participate in approving or rejecting proposals.

**3. ERC20 Voting Mechanism**:
The DAO uses ERC20 tokens as a means of voting. Token holders can vote on proposals based on the number of tokens they hold, giving more influence to holders with more tokens.

## Features
- **Decentralized Governance**: All decisions are made by the DAO through a voting process, ensuring no single party has control.
- **ERC20 Voting**: Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held.
- **Secure and Transparent**: The voting process is recorded on-chain, ensuring full transparency and immutability.

## How It Works
- A proposal is created by the DAO to send a transaction.
- Token holders vote on the proposal using their ERC20 tokens.
- If the proposal receives the required number of votes, the transaction is executed.
- If not, the transaction is rejected.
